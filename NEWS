Changes on 1.2.0 since 1.1.0:

* Implemented accessibility for the desktop managed by pcmanfm.

* Added missing accessibility relations between main window parts.

* Added tooltips for desktop items. Tooltips contain full file names,
    while desktop text shows them truncated in case of long names.

* For LibFM version 1.2.0 (and newer) show version of LibFM in the About
    window as well, not just PCManFM version.

* Added support for configuration options of LibFM 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 into
    Preferences dialog.

* Adopted new LibFM APIs and disabled all the deprecated calls.

* Implemented separated desktop configuration for each monitor. The
    Desktop Preferences dialog will be applied only to current monitor.
    If no setup was ever done for secondary monitor then setup will be
    copied from primary one. Configuration will be converted into new
    style from old one on the first start of PCManFM desktop manager.
    The new configuration will be not known to old version of PCManFM so
    if you start old one again, it will gain default configuration for
    the desktop instead.

* Changed representing of sort mode in config file: instead of numerics
    'sort_type' and 'sort_by' it's saved as 'sort=<list>' text setting.
    Thus it is possible to save extended modes such as 'case' or 'mingle'
    and save sort by extended columns (see LibFM new APIs).

* Implemented saving of columns (works for Detailed List View mode). The
    list of columns is represented as <name>[:<width]. This feature will
    work with LibFM 1.0.2 or newer. The LibFM 1.1.x will get some benefit
    only, the PCManFM can load that list from config. The possibility to
    catch columns change is available since LibFM 1.2.0 so this feature
    will work in full only with LibFM 1.2.0 or newer.

* Changed strings to follow common Human Interface Guidelines for strings
    capitalization.

* New tab with Search Results now opened in Detailed List View mode with
    columns: Name, Description, Location, Size, Modified. Since Search
    Results is a special folder, its layout should be other than default.

* The 'Tools'->'Open Current Folder as Root' menu item is removed along
    with 'su_cmd' configuration option. That mode is too much dangerous
    and appropriate functionality can be achieved using DES-EMA extension
    for context menu, no need to hardcode it into PCManFM.

* Added support for extended sort modes into main menu.

* If used with LibFM 1.2.0 or newer then list of view modes in the main
    menu will be not hardcoded but list of supported view modes retrieved
    from FmStandardView widget.

* Added support for per-folder configurations: sort mode, show_hidden,
    and view mode. The settings will be loaded from the file .directory
    if it exists, the file ~/.config/pcmanfm/<profile>/dir-settings.conf
    will be used otherwise (and if linked with LibFM 1.2.0 or newer then
    the file ~/.config/libfm/dir-settings.conf will be used instead by
    the LibFM). Those settings will be saved not for each of the visited
    folders but only if 'View'->'Save for This Folder' checkbox in the
    main menu is checked, and will be forgotten after it's unchecked.

Changed representing of view mode in config file: instead of numeric
    'view_mode' it is saved in portable way as string defined by widget
    FmStandardView.

Changed representing of side pane mode in config file: instead of numeric
    'side_pane_mode' it is saved in portable way as string defined by
    widget FmSidePane.


Changes on 1.1.0 since 1.0.1:

* Corrected underscores (mnemonics) on every menu and dialog.

* Migrated to new libfm APIs for simplification.

* Fixed GTK+ 3.0 compatibility problems. Added switch --with-gtk=N to
    configure script where N is GTK+ version: 2 or 3. Default is 2.

* Added option 'Treat backup files as hidden' into 'Display' tab of the
    preferences dialog and 'Use Application Startup Notify by default'
    into 'Advanced' tab. Both have effect with libfm 1.0.2 or newer.

* Added rintime option '--new-win' to open new window instead of new tab
    when started with some directory name.

* Added runtime option '--role' to set WM_WINDOW_ROLE property which can
    be used by window manager to do arrangement of window. Works only if
    option '--new-win' is also used.

* Added search engine support. Works if compiled with libfm-gtk >= 1.0.2.

* The items which cannot act (such as "Copy" when no items selected) now
    are disabled in menu and toolbar.

* Experimental implementation of option --one-screen to apply --desktop
    option only for one (current) X-Screen.

* Implemented side pane hiding, bound to 'F9' key press.


Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Implemented basic multi-monitor support.

* Implemented toggling fullscreen mode via 'F11' key press.

* Added tab 'Layout' into Preferences dialog.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
