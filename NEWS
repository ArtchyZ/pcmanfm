Changes on 1.2.0 since 1.1.0:

* Implemented accessibility for the desktop managed by pcmanfm.

* Added missing accessibility relations between main window parts.

* Added tooltips for desktop items. Tooltips contain full file names,
    while desktop text shows them truncated in case of long names.

* For LibFM version 1.2.0 (and newer) show version of LibFM in the About
    window as well, not just PCManFM version.

* Added support for configuration options of LibFM 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 into
    Preferences dialog.

* Adopted new LibFM APIs and disabled all the deprecated calls.

* Implemented separated desktop configuration for each monitor. The
    Desktop Preferences dialog will be applied only to current monitor.
    If no setup was ever done for secondary monitor then setup will be
    copied from primary one. Configuration will be converted into new
    style from old one on the first start of PCManFM desktop manager.
    The new configuration will be not known to old version of PCManFM so
    if you start old one again, it will gain default configuration for
    the desktop instead.


Changes on 1.1.0 since 1.0.1:

* Corrected underscores (mnemonics) on every menu and dialog.

* Migrated to new libfm APIs for simplification.

* Fixed GTK+ 3.0 compatibility problems. Added switch --with-gtk=N to
    configure script where N is GTK+ version: 2 or 3. Default is 2.

* Added option 'Treat backup files as hidden' into 'Display' tab of the
    preferences dialog and 'Use Application Startup Notify by default'
    into 'Advanced' tab. Both have effect with libfm 1.0.2 or newer.

* Added rintime option '--new-win' to open new window instead of new tab
    when started with some directory name.

* Added runtime option '--role' to set WM_WINDOW_ROLE property which can
    be used by window manager to do arrangement of window. Works only if
    option '--new-win' is also used.

* Added search engine support. Works if compiled with libfm-gtk >= 1.0.2.

* The items which cannot act (such as "Copy" when no items selected) now
    are disabled in menu and toolbar.

* Experimental implementation of option --one-screen to apply --desktop
    option only for one (current) X-Screen.

* Implemented side pane hiding, bound to 'F9' key press.


Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Implemented basic multi-monitor support.

* Implemented toggling fullscreen mode via 'F11' key press.

* Added tab 'Layout' into Preferences dialog.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
